Health Check Lab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this Lab we use an application from the launcher to show the value of the health check.

*Create an application using the launcher*

Create a basic application using Red Hat's launcher wizard

* Create the application using the https://developers.redhat.com/launch/wizard[launcher]
* Give your application the name `booster-health-check-spr`
* Select build and run locally
* Select `Health Check`  in the left column
* Select Spring Boot and the current `RHOAR release` and right column
* Change the `Maven Artifact` in the application information to `booster-health-check-spr`
* Click the `Set Up Application` button to download.
* Create a root folder and unzip the application in it

* Inside the folder you will see a README.adoc file 
follow the instructions in it
