External Configuration Lab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this Lab we use an application from the launcher to demonstrate how configmaps can be used to externalize configuration

*Create an application using the launcher*

Create a basic application using Red Hat's launcher wizard

* Create the application using the https://developers.redhat.com/launch/wizard[launcher]
* Give your application the name `booster-configmap-spring-boot`
* Select build and run locally
* Select `Externalized Configuration`  in the left column
* Select Spring Boot and the current `RHOAR release` and right column
* Verify the `Maven Artifact` in the application information is set to `booster-configmap-spring-boot`
* Click the `Set Up Application` button to download.
* Create a root folder and unzip the application in it

* Inside the folder you will see a README.adoc file 
follow the instructions in it

*Note:* the application can be found on https://github.com/craigivy/cloud-native-fundamentals/tree/master/6-config[github]
